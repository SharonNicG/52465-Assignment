    "### Introduction<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"introduction\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "This project sets out to examine the `numpy. random` package and some of its distributions, through a review of documentation on the package and analysis of data sets using its operations[1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### NumPy<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"numpy\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a principal library in Python[2]. Created in 2005, by Travis Oliphant, this open-source software is used for mathematical, scientific, engineering and data science programming[3]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The NumPy library provides tools to work efficiently and effectively with large quantities of numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why use NumPy over Python Lists?\n",
    "To work with a collection of elements (an array) in Python, we use lists. Lists are useful when working with varying types and small amounts of data, but how Python stores lists are slow and resource-heavy[4].\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python list is an array of signposts pointing to a location that has information about an element. This can be sufficient when working with smaller quantities or varying types of data but is a slow and resource-heavy process for larger or complex work[5].\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy’s ndarrays are homogenous (of a single type) n-dimensional (vectorised) array objects that are stored in one continuous place they can be accessed, processed and manipulated much more efficiently. Additionally, the NumPy library provides powerful multidimensional array and matrix data structures and an extensive collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on them[6]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The NumPy library also offers classes and functions to test linear algebra operations, Fourier series and random number generation[6][7]. The library is used when working with numerical data in Python and other Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib and SciPy are built on it[8]. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing NumPy<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"installing\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The only prerequisite for NumPy is Python. Installation of the Anaconda Distribution is an easy way to obtain this as it includes Python, NumPy, and other commonly used packages[9][10]. Full details of which are available here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy can also be installed with conda, with pip, or with a package manager on macOS and Linux[11][12]. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing with conda\n",
    "If you use `conda`, you can install it with\n",
    "`conda install numpy`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing via Pip\n",
    "If you use `pip`, you can install with \n",
    "`pip install numpy`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install System-wide via a Package Manager\n",
    "The NumPy documentation offers detailed guides on how to install NumPy for Linux and Mac users.\n",
    "This information is available here: \n",

    "Random numbers (numbers that cannot be logically predicted) have many uses such as the generation of encryption keys, to prevent selection bias in experimentation and the simulation of complex models and studies [13].\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate a genuinely random number requires a source of true randomness is needed. Often this is a physical input like a keystroke or a mouse click [14]. In programming, algorithms are used to generate random numbers. Algorithms adhere to a set of rules to generate random numbers[15]. While these numbers appear close to genuinely random numbers, they are generated through a deterministic process (where data required to determine the outcome is known in advance) making them pseudorandom[16][17]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard Python library offers the module random that includes functions to generate random numbers with a few basic distributions[18]. In contrast to this, the NumPy library offers the `numpy.random` module which allows for the generation of arrays of random numbers, using a wide selection of distributions and across different intervals[19].\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy’s random sampling routines can be classified in four ways:\n",
    "- Simple Random Data\n",
    "- Permutations\n",
    "- Distributions\n",
    "- Random Generator \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Number Generators\n",
    "The NumPy Package produces random numbers using Random Number Generators that define the process by which numbers are generated for use by NumPy functions. Generators are a reliable way to generate random numbers [20][21]. \n",
    "\n",
    "`numpy.random` offers several Random Number Generators. By defining the Generator, you wish to use at the start of your script, and your code becomes stable and reliable[22]. This will be explored more in the `Seeds` section. For now, we will choose the Generator for use in this notebook[23]. Its methods will be applied until the generator type is reset. "
