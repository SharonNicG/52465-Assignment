# Programming for Data Analysis 52465 - Assignment

### Assignment Description
The assignment concerns the `numpy.random` package in Python. 
It requires the creation of a Jupyter notebook explaining the use of the package.
This includes detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package.

There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in the Jupyter notebook.
1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
