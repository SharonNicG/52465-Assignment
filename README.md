# Programming for Data Analysis 52465 - Assignment

### Assignment Description
The assignment concerns the `numpy.random` package in Python. Full details available [here](https://github.com/SharonNicG/52465-Assignment/blob/main/ProgDA_Assignment.pdf).

It requires the creation of a Jupyter notebook explaining the use of the package.
This includes detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package.

There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in the Jupyter notebook.
1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

### Prerequisites for the Assigment
To complete the assignment I installed the the full Anaconda package from: https://www.anaconda.com.

The packages are used in this repository (detailed below) are all part of the Anaconda package:
- Jupyter Noteboo - Available via https://anaconda.org/anaconda/jupyter or https://jupyter.org/
- NumPy package - Available via  https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy or https://numpy.org/
- Seaborn - Available via https://anaconda.org/anaconda/seaborn or https://seaborn.pydata.org/
- Matplotlib - Available via  https://anaconda.org/anaconda/matplotlib or https://matplotlib.org/

#### Running a Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter is a Python package and does not require importation from Python packages. It is commonly run from the machine command line.

To launch a Jupyter notebook, open your terminal/command line and navigate to the directory where you have saved the pulled jupyter notebook. 
By typing the command `jupyter notebook`into your terminal/command line an instance of jupyter will be created on a local server. 

When `jupyter notebook` was been called from your terminal/command line a  browser window should open showing the Jupyter Notebook interface.
If it does not you can copy the url presented in the terminal/command line and paste this into your browser's address bar.

Once you have accessed the Jupyter Notebook interface, you can views the files in the current directory. Clicking on the files will open them. 
Jupyter notebook files are identifable by their notebook icon (within the Jupyter Notebook interface and by the file extension `.ipynb`

To close the notebook, terminate the broswer tab by lcicking the "X" in the top right corner.
To stop the instance on the local server and shutdown the jupyter kernel, in the terminal/command line press control-C.

The above steps should allow for the jupyter notebook to display automatically (assuming the prerequisites have been met). 
Jupyter Notebooks can also be rendered by pasting the url presented in the terminal/command line on the site https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
